  \begin{rSection}{Experience}

  \begin{rSubsection}{Impero Software}{June 2022 - Feb 2024}{Software Engineer (Ruby on Rails and .NET)}{Remote}
        \item Resolved a high volume of support tickets, focusing on data integration issues, application bugs, and production data fixes using Ruby on Rails.
        \item Worked as part of a Ruby on Rails scrum team, contributing to the development and maintenance of the main web application and its data integration service.
        \item Led the development of a new .NET-based data integration service, transitioning from Ruby on Rails development and quickly acquiring new skills in .NET and ASP.NET Core.



  
      % \item Collaborated on three teams developing and maintaining the web side of a classroom management and student wellbeing solution, with a focus on data integrations.
      % \item Started on a support engineering team debugging Rails apps in production, correcting data-related problems with the Rails console, and documenting the issues, before also joining a Rails scrum team.
      % \item Developed new features like a dashboard for managing user groups across the entire district and a merge duplicate student tool that accounted for all the associated data.
      % \item Investigated and fixed data integration problems including a JSON API not sending all the requested data, daily jobs building single objects with over 1 Gb memory, calls to external APIs being made wrong, status codes not being handled, logical bugs in business logic like date handling and data validation.
      % \item Joined a new .NET scrum team for implementing a replacement .NET architecture for the Rails data integrations. Quickly acquired proficiency in .NET, ASP.NET Core, and EF Core and took on a leadership role in the initial development phase of the new system.
      % \item Took charge of implementing large parts of the new architecture including EF Core class libraries, an ASP.NET Core REST API, a console application for scheduling processes, and several complete data integrations. Also developed a file import that handled a zip file with over 20 CSVs, a basic React app to display data from the API, and Azure pipelines to automate deployment, testing, and coverage reporting processes.

      % sending pages without all the data, wrong assumptions about external APIs being used, incorrect logic with handling of start and end dates, and many other issues in business logic
      % \item Improved memory use of daily jobs and identified some building single data objects of over 1 Gb memory unnecessarily.
      % \item Developed data integrations with a new architecture using .NET, ASP.NET Core, and EF Core 
      % \item Front-end work with Stimulus with Rails and a React app with ASP.NET Core
      % \item Fixed problems including an internal web service not sending data due to incorrect pagination logic, daily jobs building data objects of over 1 Gb memory, external APIs being called incorrectly, logical bugs in business logic
      % \item Fixed data-related problems in production Rails apps with the Rails console to resolve support tickets and came up with workarounds when necessary.
      
      % \item Refactored daily jobs to optimize memory including one from using 1.8Gb to 500Mb.
      % \item Lead effort to develop new middleware system for data integrations, replacing parts of the legacy Ruby code with .NET services
